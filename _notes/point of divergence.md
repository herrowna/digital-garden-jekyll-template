title: point of divergence
---

Popular in science fiction, used to illustrate where series of events start to divert, either through external forces (butterfly effect) or human decision-making.

In the [[curiousity trails]] salon, I pondered on the question:

>  Is the connection between curiousity and reality deterministic? Do we choose what we're curious about, or are they innate, perhaps even predestined?

In [[hypertext fiction]], points of divergence are presented through hypertext links, which is what I just presented to you. Go forth, wanderer!
