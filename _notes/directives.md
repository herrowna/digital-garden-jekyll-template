title: ruthlessly distill knowledge into directives
---

Derek Sivers recommends ruthlessly editing your notes until you have a distilled version of a takeaway. If you already trust somebody with their knowledge, then the rest is fluff. His motto is ['just tell me what to do'](https://sive.rs/2do).

At the end of reading a book, challenge yourself to distill the book into ten sentences, each carrying a directive.

This method will help me distill thoughts and turn each directive into an [[atomic note]].
