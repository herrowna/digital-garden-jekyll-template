title: transitioning from lurking to contirbuting

Crossing the chasm between consuming, tastemaking and creating.

**Shitscrolling**
Scrolling a timeline or media feed can be very rewarding, every new item that surfaces is an opportunity to experience serendipity or an instant dopamine hit.

**Admiring quality work**
Interacting with a body of work is slow and mindful, especially when there is motivation to digest the content slowly (e.g. to give feedback or support to a friend). 

In this stage, you also have a growing curiousity for tastemaking, because you want to understand the body of work that is being presented to you, and you want to [[unpeel the layers of nuance]] that are encased in a piece of work.

**Moment of realisation**
After interacting with somebody else's work, you start to admire their efforts in contribution and realise you also want to [[put yourself out there]].
