title: hypertext fiction
---

A non-linear series of literature interconnected through hypertext links in new media.

The format is credited to Borges's essay, 'The Garden of Forking Paths'. The essay itself does not have a textual infinity nature, but laid out the foundations for readers to explore this method of writing.

Since the birth of computers, this new media format has been widely adopted by writers, game producers, and artists alike.
