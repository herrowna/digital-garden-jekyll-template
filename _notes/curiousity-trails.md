A [[choose your own adventure]] game where the wanderer explores a curiousity by deep diving into topics and activities that spark something in the protagonist. 

# Curiousity Trails: Making Connections That Frame Our Reality

What drives our curiousity? Where does [[the spark]] originate from? Is it the cause of nature or nurture?

When we're curious about something, we seek to [[unpeel the layers of nuance]] and add more 'words' to our  corpus of understanding. We embark on a [[choose your own adventure]] game that leads to many [points of divergences](/point-of-divergence){: .internal-link}, compiling these nodes together eventually frame the reality of our life. 

Our curiousity paves the way for our hobbies, side hustles, projects, and hopefully our career and lifelong friendships.

There are a few ways to check for signs of curiousity:

- Look at your [box of curiousities](/shape-of-curiousity){: .internal-link}
- Random stuff you collect
- Career, side hustle, your body of work
- Colours you pick, food you eat, clothes you wear
- !!! it's everywhere

Curiousity changes us slowly at first but eventually hits [escape velocity](https://twitter.com/david_perell/status/1271262879920975872) which sends you straight down the rabbit hole. At what point do you realise you're not the same person anymore? Or perhaps become more of yourself?
