An effort to fix my shit
Get to the bottom of my ennui and surface whatever it is that needs to be told in a story
Writing as a form of catharsis, to let go of a previous chapter
Recurring dreams back in Malaysia, dreams of people from high school, dreams of my sibling, my parents, usually weird and too up close, too intense, always circling back to old memories

A series of events I hope to achieve
Get to know my trauma → apply tools to help me recover from trauma quicker → piece together what has made me close up to opportunities, shy or unwilling to be adventurous → find out who (as in IFS) in my head is making me say 'no', then apply therapy & encouragement to that part of me → start to be more proactive with taking care of myself, managing relationships, increasing productivity, and willingness to try new things or learn stuff in general (a strong desire to become more knowledgable but often get collapsed into the density of rabbit holes) → Get better at avoiding things/people/foods that trigger me → Catch the early symptoms of me spinning out of control
