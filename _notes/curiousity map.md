<h5>4. If you learned it by following your own curiosity, or doing something special, then it’s not obvious</h5>
<p>Everything you know, you had to learn.</p>
<p>If you learned something by following your interests, perhaps going down a Wikipedia rabbit hole, or a YouTube spiral, then it’s likely that others haven’t.&nbsp;If you’ve learned it doing something that most people haven’t done, like work at a super secret company or <a href="https://waitbutwhy.com/table/whats-favorite-secret-travel-spot" onclick="javascript:window.open('https://waitbutwhy.com/table/whats-favorite-secret-travel-spot'); return false;" target="_blank" rel="noopener">travel to Kyrgyzstan</a>, then you can be fairly sure lots of people don’t know about that.</p>
<p>Either way, you’re qualified to share the knowledge with the world.</p>
