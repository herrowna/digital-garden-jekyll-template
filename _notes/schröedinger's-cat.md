Applying the analogy to [[curiousity trails]]: 

> For every decision you make that [[point-of-divergence | alters the trail of your life]], curiousity is the superposition; there are many possibilities for your trail, but because of your curiousity it leads you to make a decision that then defines reality. The decision-making is akin to making an observation on a quantum element, which collapses the wave function.
