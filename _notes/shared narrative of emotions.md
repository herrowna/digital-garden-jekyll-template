title: shared narrative of emotions

# Summary
    
This is an intellectually-bounded conversation on emotions through metaphors. We pick any emotion from the wheel and try to connect the constellation of sensations, contexts, and feelings to an overarching narrative. We do this through a mix of metaphors, literary quotes, memes, motifs, and myths. 

Each person shares their emotional highlights of the month. Intellectual and emotional labour is used to dissect each story. Surprisingly, the 'shadow side' of an individual's experience is often mirrored by others. We use this common thread to enrich our understanding of our personal circumstances through the collective imagination. 

We generate new stories and ask new questions so that we may overcome the 'dyslexia' and dissonance typically experienced behind closed doors. Behind our eyes.

# The Workshop Process

![](/assets/emotions-wheel.png)

## Setting Up the Board

-   Each participant picks a Post-It note colour. Mark it with your name.
-   Each pick an emotion from the wheel above.
-   On the whiteboard, create a frame for each participant's chosen emotion.

## Creating Metaphors
-   Use your colour-coded Post-It note to write a metaphor for each emotion labeled on the board.
-   It helps to sit back with your eyes closed. Say the emotion in your head, see if there are bodily sensations felt, or memories that come to mind.
    -   _Hesitance feels like..._

## Relating to Metaphors

Once you're done, take a few minutes to read through everybody else's writing. Try to feel & relate to what is being written. Get curious about why the other person wrote this.

## Discussion

-   Compare the depth of each other's emotions, use this opportunity to dig deeper into the metaphors. Be wary of asking for too much detail, if the other person is not ready to share. Honour each other's vulnerability.
-   Some ideas for asking questions:
    -   _Can you explain why you used the analogy of a \_?_
    -   _What are the felt sensations when you experience \_?_
    -   _[How do you react, what happens, when you believe that thought?](https://thework.com/instruction-the-work-byron-katie/)_
    -   It also helps to write down your insights with more sticky notes. We tend to realise emotions are interconnected, feeling one emotion tends to lead to another. Take some time to explore that relationship.

## The Goal

-   Increase emotional vocabulary
-   Enrich emotional experiences
-   Appreciate the complexity of emotions
-   To create a culture of intra-personal & inter-personal awareness
-   To provide emotional labour for each other

## Commitment

-   After a trial run with the same group of people for 3-4 sessions, we were able to deepen our understanding of each other's emotional landscapes and connect them to the individual's personal narrative. We understand better what the person is going through, what has led them to this discussion, and make sense of why this is a shared curiosity among all.
-   The activity will also benefit those who only want to participate for 1 session. It will help you see how cultural and individual differences lead to the manifestation of different sensations, behaviours, responses, blockages, feelings...

> new features of agency are enabled when we understand stories that are explicitly about our selves: we gain the ability to plan and act on plans.

## ⚠ This Activity is Not...

-   **Group therapy**. It is not meant to be a space for ranting or a place to ask for advice. We simply listen and try to sense for a common emotion. We find new ways to relate our experience with more metaphors and motifs, so that we may take it away for further reflection.
-   An opportunity for **trauma bonding** or **love bombing**. We do not influence each other to change our narratives, or consume it as our own. Affection and compassion is given through active listening and clarification.

## Personal Insights & Reflections

Metaphors help us 'match' the severity of an ambiguous experience through story telling. Often times, people who have experienced trauma or abuse feel ambivalent towards what has happened to them. This activity lends the individual a 'voice' and vocabulary to make sense of their situation through a familiar concept.

### Hero's Journey

![](assets/heros-journey.png)

Most of the participants are coming to the discussion from various stages of the **Unknown**. Often times, we will speak about the **threshold guardians** that stand in our way, or offer stories of **relevation** and how we aim to **transform** ourselves. In a way, fellow buddies also act as **helpers** in understanding our own Hero's Journey.

### What is Mine to Carry?

It is in our ego's best interest to conserve what we already know about ourselves. A participant shared that their relevation is like an internal obliteration ('like living in a blender'). Something inside is obliterating, sending shattered pieces flying in every direction. The ego wants to go back to the previous state, everything smooth and perfect. Courage, introspection and __shadow work__ allows us to piece it back together, whereas compassion allows us to appreciate the mended state.

As we go along our journey, we also come across many emotions that are shared by our ancestry. The intergenerational trauma, historical ties, unspoken words from those that have left...all add complexity to how we react to certain emotions. We must be mindful of what we're meant to carry, and let go of outdated beliefs, resentment, hatred, anxieties and insecurities.

> The journey is long, the waters are cold and the journey is here to stay; are you going to keep moving?

My favourite metaphor from this activity: Exploring my emotions is akin to embarking on a night sea journey. The waters are cold, the air is dense with fog, and darkness looms large. As I paddle along the way with my little raft, participating in this activity is like holding up a lantern in the dark. As I light the way forward, I come to notice that others are also holding up their lanterns, and I feel less lonely on my journey. I feel assured that even though I can't see anyone through the thick fog, there is going to be light surrounding me, and we may even come to cross paths, no matter how fleeting a moment. The imagery of a dark night at sea lit up by lanterns offer me solidarity and courage.

> "Your task is not to seek love, but find the barriers within you" - Rumi

On the question of 'What is mine to carry?', I realised that I've been carrying a bucket of resentment with me along this journey. The bucket is heavy, and it weighs down my raft. The added weight invites splashes of cold water into my raft, and I'm half drowning and paddling. To continue my journey, I must empty the buckets (whatever the contents may be), so that I can fish out the water that keeps splashing into my raft.
